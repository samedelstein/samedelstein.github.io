         <p>Analyzing trends is key to understanding how work gets done within the organization, allows departments to see where improvements can be made or successes have happened, and are the beginnings toward making predictions about what will happen in the future.</p>
        <h2>Road Reconstruction</h2>
        <p>While researching how to improve road infrastructure in the city, it became clear that the quality of roads was dropping faster than the city could repair them. Using more than 15 years of data, we could see that roads lasted about 12 years after first being repaved. At current budget levels of about $3 million, the cost of reconstructing roads was too expensive. More preventative maintenance was needed. Using trend analysis, we showed that interim repairs could extend the life of a road, improving overall quality and making it safer to drive.</p>
        
        <h2>Dashboards</h2>
        <p>Dashboards are useful for showing many different data points, including trends, in one place. For our infrastructure work, dashboards were used to track where departmnets were meeting performance metrics. With the Fire Department, we are introducing them to how data can be vizualized and trends can be analyzed so they have a better idea about their own operation. They are also well set up to start measuring performance on a regular basis.</p>
