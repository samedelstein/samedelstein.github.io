  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Automating collection pothole data</h3>
  <p>The Department of Public Works gets more than 1,000 pothole complaints per year, and fills about 10 times that many. Beyond notes on paper, the department had no way of counting how many potholes they fill and where they fill them. Using an app or filling out a form was too labor intensive, so instead we used GPS data from the pothole filling trucks to track where potholes were being filled. Now that data can be used to report how much work the department does, predict where potholes might occur in the future, and save the department time.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Measuring water flows in fire hydrants</h3>
  <p>When the fire department responds to a fire and needs to use a fire hydrant, they had no data on how much water would flow from an individual hydrant. Working in partnership with the Water and Fire departments, we built an app that allowed fire staff to collect data from about 300 hydrants across the city. Using that data, we predicted the remaining flow rates for fire hydrants with about 70% accuracy.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Determine where sidewalk curb corners are ADA compliant</h3>
  <p>The Federal Highway Administration required a plan from every municipality around the country about how they planned to bring sidewalk curb corners into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Without dedicated staff to document curb corners or a system with which to record the data, we worked with the Community Geography program at Syracuse University to develop an app where students could log the data. In less than one year, students collected data from more than 7,000 curb corners, saving the City hundreds of hours of work, and allowing the city to respond to FHWA adequately.</p>
