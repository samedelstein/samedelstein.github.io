        <p>Dashboards are designed to keep track of how work is progressing and to aid in identifying or diagnosing challenges for specific initiatives or departments within the city.</p>

        <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>During our work to improve infrastructure in the city, we held monthly performance meetings with relevant departments and used dashboards to track progress toward mutually agreed upon goals. We built <a href="dashboards.syrgov.net" target="_blank">dashboards.syrgov.net</a>, which updates automatically daily, so everyone involved had access to the data they needed at any time from any place. The performance meetings along with the dashboards ensured that data-driven decisions were made, and everyone started with the same information.</p>
        
        <h2>Fire</h2>
        <p>The Fire Department requested help with looking at their incident data. They respond to many false calls, which ends up costing time and money for the department. In reviewing the data and making recommendations, it also became clear that they would benefit from seeing their data in a variety of different ways. The department had not mapped or visualized their data before. The dashboards they now have access to are still a work in progress, but they track:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Response times</li>
        <li>Frequent callers</li>
        <li>False calls</li>
        <li>Vacant properties</li>
        <li>Opioid response</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Access to real-time data helps the department understand their operation, and opens an opportunity for more data-driven decision making along with performance tracking.</p>
