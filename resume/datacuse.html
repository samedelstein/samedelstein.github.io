  <h3 style="text-align:center;">The City of Syracuse's First Open Data Portal</h3>
  <p>In July 2017, the City of Syracuse launched its first Open Data Portal, making data collected and created by the City available to the public in an easy-to-access and understand format. Since its launch, more than 30 datasets have been posted, including information about housing, infrastructure, and public safety. Data on the site has been used by partner organizations in the city and during hackathons. Thousands have visited the site since its introduction.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Customized information for each section of the City</h3>
  <p>At every TNT or neighborhood meeting I've attended as a City of Syracuse employee, attendees always ask specific questions about how much work the city is doing in their specific section of the city. There were not always easy answers available. With DataCuse, when possible, data is broken up by TNT area so neighborhood groups can easily access information about how many water main breaks, or fires, have occurred nearby.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Demand-driven Open Data</h3>
  <p>Data is published based on what people demand the most. Releasing data to the public is important when it comes to transparency, but to truly get the benefits of open data, the information needs to be used. That is why people can make recommendations about what types of data they would like to see published, and can submit projects they have completed using city data.</p>
