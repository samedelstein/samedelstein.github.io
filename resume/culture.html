        <p>Measuring change in the data culture in the city is challenging, and there is still a long way to go. There are some specific ways that the culture around data has improved, though.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The City hired its first Chief Data Officer - the only position with this title in any city in New York State.</li>
          <li>The establishment of a data users group, which convenes all the people within the city who work with data in some capacity to discuss data challenges and opportunities. Going forward, this type of group has potential for expansion.</li>
          <li>Working with the Fire Department to analyze its data. Without a data analyst on its staff, but knowing that there was a lot of value in the data, the department asked for help in order to improve its operations.</li>
          <li>Thanks to a grant from the attorney general's office, the city implemented a software called Building Blocks that centralizes large amounts of data related to housing. This platform is used by departments across the organization to prioritize inspections and identify opportunities for investment.</li>
          <li>Data sharing has increased, with an agreement with the Syracuse-Onondaga Planning Agency to share data regularly, as well as the Syracuse Police Deparment, staff across the organization have access to more data than they ever have had before.</li>
          </ul>
