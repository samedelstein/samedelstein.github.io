  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Predicting water main breaks</h3>
  <p>With the challenge of improving water infrastructure in Syracuse, we heard many reasons why water mains break from Water Department staff. None of these reasons were the sole cause for breaks, but they all seemed to have legitimacy. We knew we had good historic data and thought we could predict where water mains might be most likely to break. Partnering with the Data Science for Social Good program allowed us to work with technical experts to help solve the data problem. The team came to visit Syracuse, and delivered a product that gets used whenever projects are planned. The value of the partnership was more than $100,000, and the savings the city has gained thanks in part to the model they built is more than $1 million.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Open Data and Performance Manangement</h3>
  <p>What Works Cities is a Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative that helps medium-sized cities like Syracuse use data more effectively. We worked with What Works Cities to establish an open data policy, launch an open data portal, and improve our performance management work. The partnership also gives us access to the nearly 100 other cities in the country working with What Works Cities - offering a community of resources. The full grant from Bloomberg was more then $40 million to work with 100 cities.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Hackathons</h3>
  <p>Hack Upstate is a regional hackathon that takes place twice per year. Hundreds of participants come to learn and build technological tools. In the past two years, we have worked with Hack Upstate twice. First we released road infrastructure data and asked participants to analyze it. Thirteen projects were submitted, and AT&T funded prizes for the winners. This past year, we made an open call for people to use DataCuse data in their projects. A special "Civic Hack" prize was offered and the winning team used pothole data in their project. Partnering iwth Hack Upstate helps engage the technology community in the area with civic challenges and the data that could help to solve them.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Projects and grants</h3>
  <p>Knowing the level of expertise at Syracuse University, our goal has been to engage interested parties in our work. The School of Engineering and Computer Science is working with us on purchasing and installing Internet of Things nodes in several spots across the city. The School of Information Studies has provided numerous interns as well as subjuect matter experts. The Maxwell School has helped with projects like collecting sidewalk curb corner and catch basin data, as well as analyzing fire incident data.</p>
