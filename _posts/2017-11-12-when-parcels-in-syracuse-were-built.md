On DataCuse, the City's Open Data Portal, we post a really interesting dataset with a ton of information about all of the parcels in the city. You can check out the dataset <a href ="http://data.syrgov.net/datasets/parcel-data-august-2017" target = "_blank">here.</a>

Parcels are areas of land that generally have some kind of building of structure on them, though they can also be areas for parks. 

With so many variables in the dataset, it can be overwhelming to look at more than 50 columns and 40,000 rows on a spreadsheet. I broke those rows and columns down into maps focusing on different variables. I'll post on the different topic areas over the next couple of days.

First, I wanted to look at the year the structure was built on the parcel. Some of the data is not always perfect, and the data displayed shows when the most recent structure was built - so if a building was there before, then demolished and rebuilt, we would only see the most recent year.

Looking at maps like this is the first step in an exploratory data analysis. I might have a general question about where, when, and what types of structures were built in the history of the City of Syracuse. These maps let me see that most structures were built in the early part of the 1900s, and were mostly residential. More recently, larger parcels have been developed that are not as focused on residential. Any residential properties that were built since the 1950s are mostly on the edges of the city. The other thing to remember is that residential parcels are tiny relative to the size of the entire city. Single and two family parcels make up more than three-quarters of all the parcels in the city, so even though it might be difficult to see each individual parcel on the map, they represent the vast majority of parcels.
