title: "A Couple Things I Built"

I've been using different ESRI products for mapping and application development purposes recently. Here are a couple of the things I've built.

First is this [Public Road Closure](http://syr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Viewer/index.html?appid=117110e0275d484d878df3eb17373a1a) notification map that tells people in the City of Syracuse when a road is going to be closed for construction or a festival. Ultimately, people in different city departments will be responsible for updating the map with the road closures their department.

Second is a StoryMap that details our [Innovation Team](http://syr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=3be8dd628bf74cc99ea49ca9916578f8) initiatives. This is a cool way to tell a story, and I'll definitely be doing more with this tool in the future.

More to come on this, and other work related announcements in a couple of weeks!
