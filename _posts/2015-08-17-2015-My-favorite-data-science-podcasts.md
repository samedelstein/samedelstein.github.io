This is an exciting time to be interested in data science and love the podcast medium. It seems like more and more data-related podcasts are starting every week. Even podcasts that are not directly focused on data science will sometimes focus on data as a key part of their show.

Here are my favorite data science podcasts:

### [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com)
This podcast is funny and informative. They look at the week's data stories and break down why they are interesting and often how to apply data science tools and thinking to solve the problems or issues that the article presents. More recently, they've focused on theme episodes, so they get really deep on a subject like data science in art.

### [Linear Digressions](https://www.udacity.com/podcasts/linear-digressions)
Quick episodes about individual topics in data science. This podcast comes from Udacity, so they often talk about the specific course that can help you learn how to tackle the issue they are discussing.

### [Data Skeptic](http://dataskeptic.com/)
He flips back and forth between quick hits on topics in data science (what is K-nearest neighbors or z-scores) and long interviews with experts in the field. He is able to keep the content relatable while still going into depth about different issues.

### [Hot Takedown](http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/hot-takedown/)
Sports and data science - can't get much better! If you're a fan of things like sabermetrics, you'll like this podcast. They take on the week's news in sports hot-takes and find ways to either legitimize or take down the hot-take using data. The podcast is created by FiveThirtyEight, so it is interesting to hear how they approach questions.

### [What's the Point](http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/whats-the-point/)
What's the Point is also from FiveThirtyEight and basically looks at all things data science not related to sports. They've talked about politics, open data, online trackers, and more. This is a relatively new podcast, so I'm excited to hear how it develops.

### [The PolicyViz Podcast](http://policyviz.com/the-policyviz-podcast/)
Great interviews with experts in the data visualization field - often from places like the New York Times or NPR. If you're interested in data viz, and interested in journalism, this is a great podcast. It also has pretty short episodes, so easy to listen to quickly.

### [Talk Python to Me](http://talkpython.fm/)
Though they don't always talk about data science, they have had really interesting episodes about how python is used by huge companies for data science. Learning how Netflix uses Python for data science purposes was fascinating. 

### Honorable Mentions:
These are a few other podcasts that I either like, but aren't favorites, or that I love but are only tangentially data science podcasts:

- [Data Stories](http://datastori.es/) - This podcast has some really interesting interviews, but sometimes it takes them a little while to get going. It is also almost always more than an hour long, so it is hard to find time to listen all the way through.

- [Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/) - Highly technical podcast about machine learning. Fascinating interviews and subjects, but sometimes hard to process while driving to work or going for a run.

- [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/category/freakonomics-radio/podcasts/) - Love, love, love this podcast (and their books) but not directly about data science. This is more about how to think in a different way, which so often we need to do when looking at data.

- [R Talk](http://rtalk.org/) - Brand new podcast, and since I know R, it is intriguing. But they'll have to make more episodes and work on the sound quality a bit.
