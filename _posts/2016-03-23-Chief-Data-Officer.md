I have an exciting piece of news to share in this post. As of today, I have been named the City of Syracuse's first Chief Data Officer. I'll continue working on the [Innovation Team](http://innovatesyracuse.com), but will also be able to define my role and expand my reach.

The job will likely center on the following tasks:
* Create policies and process around how to deal with the data that currently exists
* Centralize data or at least make it accessible to the appropriate departments
* Promote sharing data and talk a lot about why using data to make decisions is important
* Engage the public in learning about the data the city collects and eventually providing the data (where appropriate) to the public
* Build partnerships with organizations in Syracuse to use city data for projects

More on what I'll be doing [here](http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/cdo). I'll be posting more on my progress here as well!
