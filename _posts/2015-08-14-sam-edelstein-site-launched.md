Hello! I'll be maintaining a blog here and will write about my work with the [Innovation Team](http://innovatesyracuse.com), [Masters degree work](http://ischool.syr.edu), and more. I'll also likely include code snippets from R (which I'm pretty comfortable with), SQL, and Python (which I'm still learning.)

The posts won't have a set schedule. I'll look to publish posts when I have something useful to write.

Some other details: This site is written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
