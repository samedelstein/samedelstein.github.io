I wrote a blog post on the [Innovation Team's blog](www.innovatesyracuse.com) about how we use data to diagnose problems and come up with solutions.

You can read the whole post [here](http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/led-by-data). In it, I look at the data we have on road ratings, and describe how the fact that we are seeing more and more streets lose quality helps us to find some potential solutions for improving roads overall.
