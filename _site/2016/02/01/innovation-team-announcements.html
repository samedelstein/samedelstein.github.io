      <p>Last week was an exciting one for the Innovation Team where I work.</p>

<p>Mayor Stephanie Miner delivered her State of the City address, and a major portion of the speech was dedicated to announcing that the city would be moving forward with some of the recommendations we have proposed.</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="http://www.syrgov.net/uploadedFiles/A_Content/2016-01-28%20State%20of%20the%20City%20Address.pdf">full text</a> with accompanying <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/city-of-syracuse-office-of-the-mayor/miner-calls-for-greater-economic-opportunity-for-all-in-2016-state-of-the-city-a/1035228529853898">press release</a>. One of my data visualizations, showing how roads are rapidly declining in the city, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Xo82GXTbPdR3RkV0Jyc2JkMnM/view">was used</a> during the speech (see page 41). I even got to sit in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/city_of_syracuse/24678984116/in/album-72157661781835183/">front row</a> (mostly as a seat filler, but I’ll take it!).</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/2016/1/28/recommendations">recommendations</a> were as follows:
1. Use data and technology to better manage our infrastructure systems
1. Coordinate construction amongst different departments and private utilities.
1. Deliver better customer service to both hear service requests from residents and deliver news about upcoming construction more effectively.</p>

<h2 id="data-and-technology">Data and technology</h2>
<p>I love this section of our recommendations because it is fun to think about incorporating data into decision-making within the city.</p>

<p>Some of the specific solutions here, include using sensors on water mains to better detect leaks. The thought here, is that if we find leaks, we can fix them before they become breaks. This is less expensive and allows the city to plan the fix, rather than responding to the emergency constantly. I played a large part in identifying the product we will likely use here.</p>

<p>We will also pilot another sensor technology that finds potholes on roads and records them on a map so the city can better plan how to repair the potholes. This also goes to maintaining the roads better and increasing their lifetimes. I discovered the company we will likely use.</p>

<p>Doing quite a bit of data analysis on road quality led me to realize that we needed more preventative maintenance on our roads. Through this analysis, I’ve been able to find the average lifespan of a road in Syracuse. Then, with some more research into techniques for maintenance, I’ve hypothesized some ways to increase the lifespan of a road so the city could afford to create a sustainable plan for roads. You can read more about my work on this <a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/led-by-data">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="coordinate-construction">Coordinate construction</h2>
<p>When there is construction in the city, oftentimes it is not fully planned with other departments. This means that it is common for a road to be newly paved, and then dug into soon after. The lack of coordination is expensive and disruptive to residents.</p>

<p>To better plan, I created a construction coordination map that also serves as a <a href="http://syr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Viewer/index.html?appid=117110e0275d484d878df3eb17373a1a">construction notification map</a>. This map allows residents to see where upcoming construction is happening, but before this map is published, workers in different departments can see more information about upcoming projects so they can coordinate first.</p>

<h2 id="better-customer-service">Better customer service</h2>
<p>We want to make it easier for people to inform the city about problems with infrastructure in the city. Additionally, we want them to know where disruptions are occurring. That is where the <a href="http://syr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Viewer/index.html?appid=117110e0275d484d878df3eb17373a1a">notification map</a> comes in.</p>

<p>To hear from residents better, we created a new <a href="http://cityline.syrgov.net">website</a>. This is the first step in a process of evaluating and improving on the existing systems set up for taking customer service requests. I’ve spent a lot of time hearing from many different vendors and potential solutions for taking customer service requests.</p>

<p>We will continue to build on all of these solutions and will track how well they are working so we can improve on them.</p>

<p>More to come…</p>
